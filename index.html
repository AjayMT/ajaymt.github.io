<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I am a senior at the <a href="https://illinois.edu">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>
majoring in Computer Science + Chemistry.</p>
<p>I enjoy working on programming languages, computer systems and
<a href="https://github.com/AjayMT">open source</a> software.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Most of my work is exploratory; I write software to learn and experiment with new ideas.
Here are some of the things I've built:</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/AjayMT/nanoc">nanoc</a></strong> is a compiler, assembler and linker
for a small subset of C. It produces ELF-formatted executables for 32-bit x86 machines.</p>
<p>I wrote nanoc because I wanted a simple, portable and dependency-free compiler toolchain for my
hobby <a href="https://github.com/AjayMT/mako">operating system</a>.</p>
</div>

<div>
<pre>
$ nanoc hello.c libnanoc.a
$ ./a.out
Hello, world!
</pre>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/AjayMT/silk">Silk</a></strong> is a systems programming language
that compiles to LLVM.</p>
<p>It is designed to be as simple and flexible as C, but more pleasant to write; to that end, it has an
ergonomic syntax and a sophisticated type system that includes parametric types. I spent approximately six
months designing and implementing the language and compiler, which is written entirely in OCaml.</p>
</div>

<h1 style="color:#f2983f;font-size:40pt;">〈Silk〉</h1>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/AjayMT/mako">Mako</a></strong> is an operating system for 32-bit
x86-compatible computers.</p>
<p>It features a graphical user interface, an ext2 filesystem, a Lua interpreter and
<a href="https://ajaymt.github.io/mako/">much more</a>. 
I wrote it entirely from scratch in approximately six months to learn about how operating systems
work (and learnt a lot more in the process.)</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/AjayMT/thorin">thorin</a></strong> is a simple debugger for C
programs on linux and macOS.</p>
<p>It uses the 
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace</a> mechanism to trace processes on
Linux and
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Mach/Mach.html">mach ports</a>
on macOS, and reads debugging information from <a href="http://dwarfstd.org">DWARF</a> files. thorin was my
first time writing Rust and exploring the System V ABI, a frustrating but very educational experience.</p>

</div>

<div>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/AjayMT/golsp">Golsp</a></strong> is an interpreted, general-purpose,
lisp-like programming language implemented entirely in Go and itself.</p>
<p>It features a simple standard library and extensible module system, and its functional purity and Go
runtime make it a good fit for highly concurrent applications. Golsp was my first time designing and implementing
a programming language from scratch.</p>
</div>

<div>
<pre>
# factorial.golsp
def [factorial 0] 1
[def [factorial n]
  * n [factorial [- n 1]]
]
factorial 6 # => 720
</pre>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/AjayMT/jtrace">jtrace</a></strong> is a
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/jvm-tool-interface.html">JVM native agent</a>
that traces the state of a Java program as it executes.</p>
<p>I wrote this tool for <a href="https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu">CS 125</a>, UIUC's introductory computer
science class.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>I'm always looking for new projects to work on, especially things that I've never done before.
Here's some of my todo-list right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build a 3D rendering engine from scratch.</li>
<li>Write a bootloader.</li>
<li>Build an optimizing compiler for a functional programming language.</li>
<li>Learn Haskell.</li>
</ul>
